# Top 50 Hospitals PrivateGpt

This Python project scrapes data from the "World's Best Hospitals 2023" ranking on Newsweek's website, uses BeautifulSoup for web scraping, Pandas for data cleaning, and GitHub for version control.

## Project Overview

This project aims to gather information about the top 50 hospitals in the world for the year 2023 from Newsweek's rankings and clean the data for analysis. It involves the following steps:

1. **Web Scraping**: We use BeautifulSoup, a Python library for web scraping, to extract data from the [Newsweek ranking page](https://www.newsweek.com/rankings/worlds-best-hospitals-2023).

2. **Data Cleaning**: Once the data is collected, we utilize Pandas for data cleaning, transformation, and organization. The goal is to make the data suitable for analysis and further use.

3. **Collaboration**: We maintain this project on GitHub, specifically in the repository [imartinez](https://github.com/imartinez). We follow the documentation and guidelines provided in the repository for version control and collaboration.

4. **Private GPT Integration**: We interact with a private GPT instance to ask questions, get responses, and potentially aid in the data analysis or any other queries.


5. **CSV Export**: After cleaning and organizing the data, we export it to a CSV file, which can be used for analysis or further processing.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas installed. You can follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imartinez/top-hospitals-project.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4 pandas
   ```

3. Run the Python script to scrape and clean the data:

   ```bash
   python scrape_and_clean.py
   ```

## Constraints

Please note the following constraints and requirements:

1. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access and scrape the Newsweek website. Respect their terms of service and robots.txt.

2. The GitHub repository provided for collaboration and version control is private. Make sure you have access to it and follow the guidelines outlined in the repository's documentation.

3. Utilize a private GPT instance for asking questions and obtaining responses. Ensure you have the necessary API credentials.

4. Verify the URL for the Newsweek ranking page, as it may change over time.

5. Ensure that you follow best practices for web scraping, such as handling errors, rate limiting, and complying with the site's terms of use.

6. Document your code and steps appropriately for transparency and reproducibility.

7. Check the project documentation and README file in the [imartinez](https://github.com/imartinez) repository for any specific guidelines and collaboration instructions.
